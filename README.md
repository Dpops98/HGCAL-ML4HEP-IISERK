# HGCAL-ML4HEP-IISERK
Tutorials done at ML4HEPv3 school organised at IISER Kolkata.

The goal of the tutorial is to take Geant4 simulation data for the High Granularity Calorimeter(HGCAL) for electron and pion 
energy regression. The link for the data is here: 

    Electron: https://zenodo.org/records/7504164
    Pion: https://zenodo.org/records/7864471

The goal is to see the performance using BDT, DNN, and GNN.
